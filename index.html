                <h3>Introduction to Semantic Markup</h3>
                <p>
                    Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to reinforce the
                    meaning of the information in web pages rather than simply to
                    define its presentation or look. By using elements like
                    <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>,
                    we create a structure that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

                    <p>
                        Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable
                        by as many people as possible. Semantic HTML, along with
                        attributes like <code>aria-label</code>, helps screen readers
                        and other assistive technologies interpret your content correctly.

                    <h4>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h4>
                    <p>
                        SEO is the process of optimizing your website to rank higher
                        in search engine results. Proper use of headings, descriptive
                        titles, and meta descriptions are foundational to on-page SEO.
